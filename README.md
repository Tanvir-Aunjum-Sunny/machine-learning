machine-learning
================

A Java library of machine learning algorithms.  These are my own implementations that I am working on for practice.

Decision Trees:
   
    ID3
    
Bayesian Networks:
   
    Naïve Bayes classifier
    
    Tree Augmented Naïve (TAN) Bayes classifier
    
    Hill Climbing Structure Search
    
    Sparse Candidate Structure Search
    
    Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
    
    Artificial Data Generation
    
Hidden Markov Models:

    Forward Algorithm
    
    Backward Algorithm
    
Generic Graph Theory Algorithms:
    
    Bellman-Ford Algorithm
    
    Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
    
    Prim's Algorithm
    
    Cycle Detection
    
    Topological Sort of Vertices in a DAG
